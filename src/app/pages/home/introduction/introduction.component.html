        I'm a software & web developer based out of Chicago, Illinois. I have been programming since the age of fifteen and it has become a passionate pursuit that I also enjoy as a hobby.
        You will often find me working on a programming project of some sort, most of which never see the light of day. 
        Some of my technical interests include Neural Networks, Angular, React, .NET/C# and API development. 
        Feel free to check out my resume and reach-out using the info below. Thanks!
